              <h3>Bio</h3>
              <p>Kevin Burgess, now better known by his stage name KB, is a rapper.
               He’s won a Dove Award (Nominated twice),
                been a Recording Academy featured artist on Grammy.com and has received critical acclaim from his peers and
                media such as Billboard Magazine and The Blaze.Like so many musicians that came before him, KB, the rapper, almost never happened.

At birth, the doctor didn’t think he’d ever be able to talk or even speak clearly,fortunately KB was able to overcome his ailment.
Growing up, hip-hop was frowned upon KB's household, because of this, KB used to hide in a closet and listen to hip-hop music on his Walkman.
Fast forward to the present and KB has already released a mixtape, a widely successful debut album and is working on his second hip-hop
studio album. And in what was once considered the disfavored music of his childhood, KB has discovered redemption.
Quite literally being the youngest man on a college campus made it difficult for KB to find friends with similar interests
 so when he heard about another student that was really into hip-hop, KB promptly sought him out and challenged him to a battle.
  KB says, “I remember him saying, ‘I don’t do that. I do Christian rap.’
   I never in my life met someone our age that would lead with their Christianity". Two weeks later,
   KB took the album home and was surprised to experience his first Christian rap album.
   And it was good. In fact, it was great! The music was a bridge for KB.
Through the music, KB discovered the message. And in that moment,
KB realized that he wanted to know God for himself and soon after he enrolled in Bible College.
KB spent four years at Trinity College studying theology with plans on missionary work in Brazil.
But in the latter part of his time at Trinity, KB would be pulled in another direction, back to the music that was the bridge to his salvation.
With a close friend, KB formed an alliance of young rappers, poets, missionaries and students entitled His Glory Alone (hga).
Through music, KB has found direction, a mission and a calling. Tomorrow We Live just may be someone else’s bridge to salvation.
Tomorrow We Live releases April 21st 2015</p>

              <h3>Bio</h3>
              <p>Gospel and praise & worship artist William Mcdowell grew up in Ohio. Musically gifted from the start,
                he was playing piano by the age of five, and by 13 he was playing drums for his church, moving to playing organ
                in the church at the age of 16, and he began leading his own worship sessions by the time he was 18.
                In 2006 he accepted a worship leader position at the Gathering Place in Lake Mary, Florida,
                 and a year later he was ordained as a pastor there. McDowell issued an ambitious two-CD set, As We Worship Live, in 2009.
                 His second album, 2011's Arise, another two-disc affair produced by McDowell and Clay Bogan III,
                 was recorded live on December 10, 2010 at the Christian Life Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
                  It topped the Billboard gospel chart and marked the musician's first appearance on the Billboard 200.
                  Recorded with a crowd of 2,000 worshipers, Withholding Nothing followed in 2013 and
                  repeated both chart feats, reaching the Top 30 of the Billboard 200.

                   Louisiana with guests including singer Travis Greene.

                 Signed to the Tyscot label, the group debuted in 1995 with Come Into This House.
                  Two years later, Haddon and company issued Live the Life, which scored Gospel Music Workshop of

                California in a family also comprised of five other sisters and a brother.

                followed by a second Matthews production, Sneaky. In 2002, the duo released Incredible,
                an album whose material was largely written by the sisters themselves.
                Both Erica and Tina became mothers before their self-titled album appeared in 2005.
                It was the duo's first album to enter the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 chart.
                Two singles, "Get Up" and "God in Me," topped the Dance Music/Club Play chart, while the latter also hit
                number one on the Hot Gospel Songs chart. Something Big,
                featuring productions from Campbell and a handful of fellow collaborators, was issued in 2011.
